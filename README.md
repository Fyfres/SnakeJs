This is a Snake that i'm trying to do the most quickly possible

### How to play

1/ Click on the "code" button.  
2/ Click on "Download ZIP".  
3/ Extract the ZIP wherever you want on your computer with winrar or 7zip.  
4/ Open the folder you just extracted.  
5/ Open the game with the file "Snake.html".  

I'll create a proper download link when the game will be totally finished.


### Time on it

Actually i've worked on it for 12h for the base game to be done  
  - 2 Game Mode : Normal with diffictulty choosing & Unlimited where you play until you loose  
  - Loosing when touching the walls or the snake body  
  - Winning when recolting every apples on the standard mode  
  - Length of the snake grow when getting an apple and shrink when getting a boost  
  - Speed increase: When on a win streak for Normal mode or with every recolted apple for the Unlimited mode  
  - Replay showing the last game played with the speed corresponding  

### Features to come

No more features planned, i'll next work on an improve of the UI and add buttons to play with the screen (for phone users mostly).
