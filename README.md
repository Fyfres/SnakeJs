# SnakeJs

This is a Snake that i'm trying to do the most quickly possible

### Time on it

Actually i've worked on it for 11h for the base game to be done
  -difficulty choosing
  -loosing when touching the walls or the snake body
  -winning when recolting every apples
  -length of the snake grow when getting an apple and shrink when getting a boost

### Features to come

I'm currently working on changing the snake speed when the player is on a win streak.
The more the player win the more the snake will speed up, it'll come back to it's normal speed once the player loose.

Next i'll work on an infinite mode where there'll be only one apple but each time the player the player get it another one will appear.
